    <h2 class="ForText">The Importance of Kindness</h2>
    <p class="Text">Kindness is a small act that can make a big difference in people’s lives. A simple smile, a helping hand, or kind words can brighten someone’s day. These actions may seem small, but they help build trust and understanding between people. Being kind also makes the world a better place. When one person shows kindness, it often encourages others to do the same. This creates a chain of positive behavior that can reduce stress and bring people closer together.
