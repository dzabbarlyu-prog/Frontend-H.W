<h2> Burgers </h2>

<p><i> Burgers are one of the most popular foods in the world because they are tasty, easy to make, and come in many different styles. A perfect burger has a soft bun, a juicy beef patty, melted cheese, fresh lettuce, tomato, and flavorful sauces that make every bite amazing. People love burgers because they can be customized with chicken, fish, or even plant-based patties. Whether grilled at home or bought from a restaurant, burgers always bring comfort and happiness. They are more than just fast food — they are a global symbol of delicious simplicity. </i></p>
